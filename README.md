## About

As an ALX Student who is undertaking the Software Engineering Program; we are provided with resources to help us grasp and understand the concepts given to us, and to further challenge our ability to learn the skill; we are tasked with completing the projects received which helps us along our way to becoming a Full-Stack Software Engineer once the program is over.
